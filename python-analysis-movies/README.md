Analyzed a K-Drama dataset to uncover trends in ratings, episode durations, and the impact of actors and directors on success. Conducted data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations using Python. Insights aim to guide streaming platforms in maximizing audience engagement.

Ratings vs. Episode Durations: Plotted scatter plots to identify correlations between ratings and durations.
Genre Trends: Analyzed genres to determine which ones performed best.
Actor with High Ratings: Analysed top 20 actors by ratings.
